I'm an Adjunct Mathematics instructor at the University of Missouri. I currently teach 4 sections of Math 1300. I recieved my masters in 2024 from the University of Missouri. My masters thesis was in Commutative Algebra on a paper by Raynaud and Gruson. I am currently looking for Ph.D. programs. My research interests are Commutative Algebra, Combinatorics, and Algebraic Geometry.
