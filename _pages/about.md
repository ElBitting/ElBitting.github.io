I'm an Adjunct Mathematics instructor at the University of Missouri. My research interests lie in the intersection of Commutative Algebra, Combinatorics, and Number theory. I recieved my mastests in 2024 from the University of Missouri. My masters thesis was in Commutative Algebra on a paper by Raynaud and Gruson. I am currently looking for Ph.D. programs.
